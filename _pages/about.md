About Me
------
Hi, I'm Jiarui Han (pronounced: JEE-ah-ray HAHN), a first-year Master's student at the School of Computer Science and Technology of Tongji University. I work in the [ADMIS Lab](https://admis-tongji.github.io/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jihong Guan](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/info/1061/2814.htm) and [Assoc. Prof. Wengen Li](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/info/1063/2826.htm). My research interests broadly lie in **multimodal learning**, with a particular focus on **cross-modal data alignment** and its applications in the **remote sensing** domain. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree from the School of Software Engineering at Tongji University.
