Hi, I'm Jiarui Han, a first-year Master's student in the Department of Computer Science at Tongji University. I work in the [ADMIS Lab](https://admis-tongji.github.io/) under the supervision of [Prof. Jihong Guan](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/info/1061/2814.htm) and [Assoc. Prof. Wengen Li](https://cs.tongji.edu.cn/info/1063/2826.htm). My research interests broadly lie in multimodal learning, with a particular focus on cross-modal data alignment and its applications in the remote sensing domain. Prior to this, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering degree from the School of Software Engineering at Tongji University.
