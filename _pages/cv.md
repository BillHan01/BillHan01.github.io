Education
======
* M.Sc. in Computer Science, Tongji University, Present
* B.Eng. in Software Engineering, Tongji University, 2025
* Exchange at School of Computation, Information and Technology, Technical University of Munich (TUM), 2024/25  


Project & Internship
======
* Open-Source Intelligence-Based Event Analysis and Evaluation Platform, 2025
  * Designed and developed an event analysis & prediction system to support real-time monitoring and intelligent analysis of open-source intelligence under evolving international scenarios. Integrated locally deployed Qwen model to perform multi-round prompt-based reasoning on social media data.
  
* Sora Model Division, Zulution.ai (CV Algorithm Intern), 2025
  * Participated in the infrastructure development for inference acceleration of large-scale video generation models. Focused on the quantization of DiT architectures (e.g., Wanx) to enable low-bit deployment with minimal accuracy degradation.
  

- Intelligent Report Generation System for Urban Service Tickets, 2025
  - Designed and implemented an automated reporting pipeline for municipal service data at Nanxiang Town’s Urban Operations Center. Leveraged LLMs to enhance data summarization and streamline the monthly production of official reports.

* Engineering Research Center for Smart City Planning, Ministry of Education of PRC, 2024
  * Participated in the National Key R&D Program of China (2020YFB2103905) on resilient urban intelligent planning and simulation. Responsible for modeling urban risk scenarios such as flood disasters and infectious diseases, and developing simulation applications, which has been deployed in urban spatial planning departments across 17 cities.
* Gait Recognition via Silhouette Generation, 2023
  * Explored generative modeling techniques to enhance gait recognition performance using silhouette-based representations.
