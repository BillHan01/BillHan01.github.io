This project was completed as part of the undergraduate Software Testing course at the School of Software Engineering, Tongji University(taught by Prof. Qingfeng Du). 

The project was collaboratively developed by Jiaheng Fu, Guanya Wu, Haoyu Zheng, and myself, and received an A grade. It reflects our understanding of software testing principles and practical skills in designing and executing effective test cases across different levels of the software testing lifecycle.

We conducted a systematic software testing process on a near-expiry food trading platform developed during a database course. The project repository includes self-developed test tools, a lightweight custom test suite, and complete reports on unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. I have also included my course notes and assignment documents as learning references.
