I’m Jiarui Han, currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Computer Science at Tongji University. I work with Prof. Jihong Guan and Assoc. Prof. Wengeng Li at the ADMIS Lab, focusing on cross-modal learning and remote sensing applications.

I plan to use this space to share things I’m working on, interesting papers I come across, and maybe a few thoughts on life as a graduate student.

Thanks for stopping by — more to come soon!
